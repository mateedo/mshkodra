                I am a student at the University of Waterloo entering my 3rd year this fall. I am studying Combinatorics & Optimization and Statistics, but who knows, maybe that is subject to change.

                I love playing soccer and the piano, and recently I started reading a lot of literature. I support Chelsea FC, the best club in London and England. I played soccer competitively when I was a kid until high school, and now I just play for fun at school and in mens leagues.

                My favourite genre of music is classical music, and so on the piano I only try to play classical music as well, though I was interested in jazz for a bit so probably when I improve I might pick up jazz in the future. My favourite composer is Rachmaninoff and second is Chopin.

                When I was a kid my Mom would make me read a lot and I stopped liking it as I grew older, but recently I picked it up again when I realized I could choose the books I was interested in reading. At the moment I'm reading "The Brothers Karamazov" by Dostoevsky and there are some other similar books in the queue for after.
